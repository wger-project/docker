# Please consult the `Deployment` section in the readme if you want to deploy
# this. You *need* to keep this nginx service, even if you have your own,
# otherwise the static files will not be served correctly! If you do remove
# it, configure yours similarly to what's in config/nginx.conf
# Also take a look at the "Static files" section in the .env file
