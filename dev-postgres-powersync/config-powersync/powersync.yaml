# yaml-language-server: $schema=../schema/schema.json

# Note that this example uses YAML custom tags for environment variable substitution.
# Using `!env [variable name]` will substitute the value of the environment variable named
# [variable name].
#
# Only environment variables with names starting with `PS_` can be substituted.
#
# e.g. With the environment variable `export PS_MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017`
# and YAML code:
#  uri: !env PS_MONGO_URI
# The YAML will resolve to:
#  uri: mongodb://localhost:27017
#
# If using VS Code see the `.vscode/settings.json` definitions which define custom tags.

# migrations:
#   # Migrations run automatically by default.
#   # Setting this to true will skip automatic migrations.
#   # Migrations can be triggered externally by altering the container `command`.

      # The connection URI or individual parameters can be specified.
      # Individual params take precedence over URI params
      uri: !env PS_PG_URI

      # Or use individual params
