    # The unified service runs an API server and replication worker in the same container.
    # These services can be executed in different containers by using individual entry commands e.g.
    # Start only the API server with
    #   command: ['start', '-r', 'api']
    # Start only the replication worker with
    #   command: ['start', '-r', 'sync']

    # Migations occur automatically by default. Default migrations can be disabled in `powersync.yaml`:
    #  migrations:
    #   disable_auto_migration: true
    #
    # Service migrations can be manually triggered by starting a container with the
    # following command:
    #     command: ['migrate', 'up']
    # Note that this container must finish executing before starting the sync or unified container.
    command: ["start", "-r", "unified"]

      # The config file can also be specified in Base 64 encoding
      # e.g.: Via an environment variable
      #   POWERSYNC_CONFIG_B64: [base64 encoded content]
      # or e.g.: Via a command line parameter
