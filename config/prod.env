# Synchronzing exercises
# It is recommended to keep the local database synchronized with the wger
# instance specified in WGER_INSTANCE since there are new added or translations
# improved. For this you have different possibilities:
# - Sync exercises on startup:
# SYNC_EXERCISES_ON_STARTUP=True
# DOWNLOAD_EXERCISE_IMAGES_ON_STARTUP=True
# - Sync them in the background with celery. This will setup a job that will run
#   once a week at a random time (this time is selected once when starting the server)

SYNC_EXERCISE_IMAGES_CELERY=True

#   docker compose exec web python3 manage.py sync-exercises
#   docker compose exec web python3 manage.py download-exercise-images
#   docker compose exec web python3 manage.py download-exercise-videos

# Synchronzing ingredients
# You can also syncronize the ingredients from a remote wger instance, and have
# basically the same options as for the ingredients:
# - Sync them in the background with celery. This will setup a job that will run
#   once a week at a random time (this time is selected once when starting the server)
SYNC_INGREDIENTS_CELERY=True
# - Manually trigger the process as needed:
#   docker compose exec web python3 manage.py sync-ingredients

# This option controls whether to download ingredients and their images from the
# configured wger instance. When scanning products with the barcode scanner, it is
# possible to dynamically fetch the ingredient if it is not known in the local database.
